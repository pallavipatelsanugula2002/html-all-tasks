            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development<br> of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project <br>is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.<br> As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.<br>Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements.<br>The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers.<br>In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents.
