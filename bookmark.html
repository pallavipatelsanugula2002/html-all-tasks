    The 3 Mistakes of My Life is the third novel written by Chetan Bhagat.<br>
    The book was published in May 2008 and had an initial print run of 420,000.<br>
    The novel follows the story of three friends and is based on the city of <br>
    Ahmedabad in western India. This is the third best-selling novel by Chetan Bhagat.<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
    The novel features a character named Radhika, who is depicted as making arrangements <br>
    for her upcoming wedding to Brijesh Gulati, a software engineer in San Francisco. <br>
    Throughout the book, Radhika reflects on her life growing up in Delhi as a studious, <br>
    introverted girl from a middle-class family. She also introduces her outgoing and popular<br>
 older sister, Aditi, and reveals her tendency to communicate with her inner "mini-me" or judgmental voice.

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        The book is narrated by Hari, with some small passages by his friends<br>
         Ryan and Alok, as well as a letter by Hari's girlfriend Neha Cherian. <br>
     It deals with the lives of 3 friends, whose elation on making it to one<br>
    of the best engineering colleges in India is quickly deflated by the rigor<br>
    and monotony of the academic work. Most of the book deals with two plot lines.<br>
     One is the numerous attempts by the trio to cope with and/or beat the system.
