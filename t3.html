            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the <br>World Wide Web,
             alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side <br>for webpage behavior,[10] 
             often incorporating third-party libraries.<br> 
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br> 
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
