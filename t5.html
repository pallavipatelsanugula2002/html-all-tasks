            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library<br>
            for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) <br>
            and a community of individual developers and companies.<br>
            React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.<br>
             Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,<br>
             React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality</p>
